Wiki for Iridium Code

= Introduction =

This will keep track of the changes made to the Iridium code and additions that need to be made. Also, an explation of the AT commands used is given. Below all that, relevant insights into working with Iridium and this code are logged.


= Details =

==Version 4==
Reset MO and MT buffers (the MO and MT buffers are supposed to reset after a session, but it is best practice to do this manually)
Interrupts for SBDIRING (currently the test code is buggy)
Low power mode
Tweak retries
Modem configuration (setting to default, setting to wanted states, etc)


==Version 3==
Cleaned up Code
Added Commenting
Receiving capability
If extra messages in gateway, daemon automatically receives
SBDIRING buggy
Added Verbose
Added Logging
Fixed a buffer initialization bug

==Version 2==
Fixed read issues

==Version 1==

Basic sending of data, no receiving
Issues with read buffer]

==Currently Supported at Commands==

Hayes AT comamnds was creating in 1977. Modems ranging from satellite, ham radio and 3/4G services still use a variant of the AT command set.

Sending a message requires the following steps:
1. Register with the constellation
2. Write a message to the MO Buffer
3. Initiate a session to transfer MO to Constellation
4. Read the output of the session and determine if there is a message in the MT buffer and if others are waiting in the constellation.
5. Read MT buffer
6. Repeat step 3 if there are messages in the gateway.

=AT+SBDWT=
Write a message to the modem's MO Buffer.

=AT+SBDRT=
Read a message from the modem's MT Buffer

=AT+SBDIX= 
Initiates a session between the modem and the satellite constellation. During this session, information stored in the MO buffer will be sent to the constellation and any messagse waiting will be sent to the MT buffer.
