P3B Onboard INDS System

This P3B INDS system was developed and tested under Fedora 8; please let us know
if there are any issues running this under Red Hat.


Installation steps:
-------------------

1. Our username under Fedora was "fedora"; our home directory was "/home/fedora".
   This home directory is hardwired in several files and needs to be changed
   to reflect your actual home directory or INDS installation location under Red Hat:
      a. INDS/environment: Edit the "INDSHOME" environment variable.
      b. INDS/inds: Edit the "INDS_HOME" script variable.
      c. INDS/start_inds: Change line 8 in this script: "cd /home/fedora/INDS".
      d. INDS/start_tomcat: Edit the "RBNB" script variable on line 6.
      e. INDS/stop_tomcat: Edit the "RBNB" script variable on line 6.

2. To use the Tomcat web interface and also to send the P3B INDS a stream of UDP
   IWG1 and Housekeeping packets, make sure the following ports are open in the
   firewall: 80, 5700, 5750

3. Install startup script: The INDS/inds script can be used within the Fedora and
   Red Hat service startup framework to automatically launch INDS at boot.  INDS
   is started at run level 5 with priority 99.  At all other run levels, INDS is
   killed with priority 05.
   Do the following to intstall this script:
      a. Login as root.
      b. Copy INDS/inds to /etc/init.d
      c. Change the owner and group status of /etc/init.d/inds both to "root" and
         make sure this file has execute permission.
      d. To install the "inds" service, execute the following:
            cd /etc/init.d
            /sbin/chkconfig --add inds
      e. Verify the INDS service installation using:
            /sbin/chkconfig --list | grep inds
   To manually start or stop the INDS system, run the following as root:
      cd /etc/init.d
      /sbin/service inds {start|stop|status}
   I found the following web pages useful in setting this service up:

System limitations:
-------------------

The INDS system launches at boot using the startup script discussed in Step 3
above.  The only issue we have come across running the system in this
"headless" mode under Fedora 8 is that PNGPlugIn does not work properly.  (You
may or may not experience the same issue under Red Hat.)  PNGPlugIn produces
a strip chart PNG image.  It is used in the strip chart web pages and also has
been used to produce screen overlays for Google Earth.  If either of these
capabilities is required, and it appears that PNGPlugIn is not working correctly,
then contact us to discuss workarounds.
